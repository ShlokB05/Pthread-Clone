Hello, this is a project that is meant to replicate a user level Pthread library with all the essential functionalities (threads, join, mutex) along with a scheduler that uses these scheduling policies: CFS, MFLQ, PSJF.

How to run the benchmark?
-------------------------
1. First, pull this github repository 

2. In the PthreadClone project root run:
	$ make clean
	$ make SCHED=PSJF or one of the other algorithms

3. Then, CD into benchmarks, do a make clean and make
	$ make clean
	$ make

4. Before running the benchmark, run 

	$ ./genRecord.sh

The genRecord generates data for external_cal.

5. Running benchmarks:

	$ ./external_cal 6 
	To edit the number of threads, you may change the 6 to any value, though 4 is set to the default if not value is provided.
